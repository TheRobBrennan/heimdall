# Welcome

One of the main focal points of this project is to explore authorization using a JWT token for `@auth` directives in the GraphQL API built on top of a [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com) backend.

I am a fan of using a free authentication provider - [Auth0](https://auth0.com) - for user authentication.

This guide aims to take you from creating an account on Auth0 to implementing a fully functional authentication solution that will handle the intricacies of JWT tokens for you.
