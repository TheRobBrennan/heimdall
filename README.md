# Heimdall

This project is a continuation of my [GRANDstack Starter for Next.js with TypeScript](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/nextjs-grandstack-starter-typescript) project.

Heimdall was one of my favorite characters in the Thor movies - known for his presence guarding the rainbow bridge leading into the entry of Asgard (see [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heimdall](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heimdall))

The goal of this project is to explore using the new alpha release of the [@neo4j/graphql](@neo4j/graphql) library within a [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io) ([GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com), [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com)) application.

Specifically, the main focus will be exploring authorization using [Auth0](https://auth0.com) for user authentication - using the JWT token for `@auth` directives in the GraphQL API that will be built on top of a [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com) backend.
